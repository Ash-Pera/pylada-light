#  PyLaDa is a high throughput computational platform for Physics. It aims to
#  make it easier to submit large numbers of jobs on supercomputers. It
#  provides a python interface to physical input, such as crystal structures,
#  as well as to a number of DFT (VASP, CRYSTAL) and atomic potential
#  programs. It is able to organise and launch computational jobs on PBS and
#  SLURM.
