#  PyLaDa is a high throughput computational platform for Physics. It aims to make it easier to
#  submit large numbers of jobs on supercomputers. It provides a python interface to physical input,
#  such as crystal structures, as well as to a number of DFT (VASP, CRYSTAL) and atomic potential
#  programs. It is able to organise and launch computational jobs on PBS and SLURM.
