Feature: simple run

    Creates and launches a calculation. The first scenario shows the standard way of using pwscf.
    The only difference is that it mocks pwscf with a script that copies pre-computed output. This
    ensure the test will run on platforms where pwscf is not available, while changing little as far
    as pylada is concerned. The other scenario go into the details of what happens behind the scene:
    we check that the functional is an iterator with two steps:

    - the first step yields a ProgrammProcess object that can execute an external binary
    - the second step yields an extraction object

    Calling pwscf directly (`pwscf(structure, outdir)`) is equivalent to iterating through the first
    step, executing it, and then returning the value of the second step. At the first iteration,
    all the input for pwscf should be present.

Background:
    Given a simple pwscf object
    And a fake pseudo 'Al.pz-vbc.UPF' in the working directory
    And an aluminum structure


Scenario: Non-scf run

    When running pwscf
    Then the run is successful


Scenario: check iteration through first step

    When iterating through the first step
    Then the yielded object is a ProgrammProcess
    And a valid pwscf.in exists
    And the marker file .pylada_is_running exists


Scenario: check iteration through the second step

    Given a serial communicator
    When iterating through the first step
    And executing the program process
    And iterating through the second step
    Then the yielded object is an Extract object
    And the extract object says the run is unsuccessful
    And the output file pwscf.out exists
    And the output file pwscf.err exists
    And the marker file .pylada_is_running has been removed
